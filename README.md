# HTMLCodeGeneratorFromUI (Fun-Den Project)
Have a UI where user can drag and drop stuffs and do actions such as Title, Headings, Text Formattings, Text Box, Drop down boxes, check boxes, so on... such that after completion of that, user can click generate HTML code and retrieve those HTML codes.


Example:
Consider Gooogle Docs -> User inputs the heading "Heading 1" then on side pane, the HTML code should be generated like below

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
  </body>
</html>
