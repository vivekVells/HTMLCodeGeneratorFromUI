# HTMLCodeGeneratorFromUI (Fun-Den Project)
- Have a UI where user can drag and drop stuffs or do actions such as typing Title, Headings, Text Formattings, Text Box, Drop down boxes, check boxes, so on... such that on side pane corresponding HTML codes should be generated based on the stuffs user do.


### Example:
- Consider Gooogle Docs -> User inputs the heading "Heading 1" then on side pane, the HTML code should be generated like below

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
